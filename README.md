# Static Code Analysis with Pylint

This repository contains a hands-on lab for installing and using Pylint to perform static code analysis on Python programs. You will learn how to check the compliance score of a Python program and fix common mistakes to improve the compliance score.

## Objectives

1. Install Pylint package.
2. Run static code analysis on a Python program.
3. Check the compliance score of a Python program.
4. Fix common mistakes and improve the compliance score.

This hands-on lab is part of the course **Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask** within the **IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate**.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the lab:

### 1. Install Pylint Package

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Pylint:
 ```bash
   pip install pylint
 ```

### 2. Run Static Code Analysis on a Python Program

Use Pylint to analyze your Python code. For example, to analyze a file named sample1.py, run:
```bash
   pylint static_code.py
 ```

### 3. Check the Compliance Score of a Python Program

Pylint will provide a compliance score based on the analysis. Review the output to identify areas that need improvement.

### 4. Fix Common Mistakes and Improve the Compliance Score

Based on the Pylint output, fix common mistakes in your code to improve the compliance score. This may include adding docstrings, following naming conventions, and ensuring proper formatting.
